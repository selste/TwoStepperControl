# Description
TSC (TwoStepperControl) is a software project by Wolfgang Birkfellner and Steffen Elste to realize an open integrated control system for astronomical telescopes. The basic idea is to use a Raspberry Pi to control a telescope and to provide basic autoguiding functionality without additional external computers. As Raspian Jessie is not an RTOS, it cannot control stepper drivers directly like a microcontroller; therefore, extra hardware is necessary which receives basic parameters (number of steps, velocity, acceleration) from the software. Currently, I am using a Phidgets 1067 bipolar driver board although other alternatives are under consideration. The steppers are monitored by the Pi in separate Qt-Concurrent threads so that software functionality is maintained during stepper operation. So far, only fork mounts are supported.
